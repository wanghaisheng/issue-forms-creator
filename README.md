> build Issue Forms with forms with ease

Issue Forms Creator is a generator for the [Github Issue Forms](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-forms) feature.
Rather than typing your own yaml file, fill a form and copy the yaml version.

Benefits :
* ✅ less prone errors
* ✅ expose the all available options
* ✅ live preview
* ✅ drag and drop support to sort your content
* ✅ use most of the [validations](https://gh-community.github.io/issue-template-feedback/structured/#common-validation-errors) made by Github
* ✅ load an existing repo to retrieve labels and contributors

## Usage

* (optional) load your repository to retrieve labels and contributors
* add and fill fields
* copy the yaml file
* create a `.yml` file into the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` folder
* paste the copied content into this new file
* commit the changes
